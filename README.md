# Python to JS translator
This is a sample demonstration of converting python to javascript using an ANTLR4 generated parser and a custom visitor. This is more of an illustration than a fully functioning library so not all the visitor functions are fully implemented. This lib is demonstrated using [py-to-js-vs-code-extn](https://github.com/kood-codes/py-to-js-vs-code-extn).
